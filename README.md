This project is inspired by the extension [Easy Snippet](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=inu1255.easy-snippet) and refers to his code and ideas. Thanks very much. Some icon resources used in the project are from [vscode-icons](https://github.com/vscode-icons/vscode-icons), and only the color is modified. This project is developed out of interest and personal needs, and may not meet the needs of everyone.
